# 7 Recursion

## Understanding Recursion
* Recursive algorithms have two cases: recursive cases and base cases.
* Every recursive case must eventually lead to a base case.
* It may be useful to write a separate wrapper function to do initialization for a complex recursive function.
* Iterative solutions are usually more efficient than recursive solutions.
* A recursive algorithm can be implemented without recursive calls by using a stack, but it's usually more trouble than it's worth.
