# Maintain Linked List Tail Pointer

## `head` and `tail` are global pointers to the first and last element, respectively, of a singly linked list of integers. Implement functions for the following prototypes:

* `bool delete(elem)`

* `bool insert_after(elem, data)`

## It should be possible to insert at the beginning of the list by calling `insert_after` with `None` as the elem argument. These functions should return a boolean indicating success. Your functions must keep the head and tail pointers current.
