# Bugs in removeHead

## Find and fix the bugs in the following function that is supposed to remove the head element from a singly linked list:

`def remove_head(head):

	del head
	
	head = head.next`

## Bug-finding strategy
* 1. Check that the data comes into the function properly.
  * Make sure you aren't accessing a variable that you don't have, you aren't reading something as an `int` that should be a `long`, and you have all the values you need to perform the task.
* 2. Check that each line of the function works correctly.
  * The function is intended to perform a task. Verify that the task is executed correctly at each line and that the desired result is produced at the end.
* 3. Check that the data comes out of the function correctly.
  * The return value should be what you expect. In addition, if the function is expected to update any caller variables, make sure this occurs.
* 4. Check the common error conditions.
  * Error conditions vary depending on the specifics of a problem. They tend to involve unusual argument values. For instance, functions that operate on data structures may have trouble with empty or near empty data structures; functions that take a pointer as an argument may fail if passed a null pointer.
