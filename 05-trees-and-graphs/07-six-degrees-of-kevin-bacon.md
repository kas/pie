# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

## The game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" involves trying to find the shortest connection between an arbitrarily selected actor and Kevin Bacon. Two actors are linked if they appear in the same movie. The goal of game is to connect the given actor to Kevin Bacon using the fewest possible links.

## Given a list of all major movies in history and their casts (assume that the names of movies and actors are unique identifiers), describe a data structure that could be constructed to efficiently solve Kevin Bacon problems. Write a routine that uses your data structure to determine the Bacon number (the minimum number of links needed to connect to Kevin Bacon) for any actor.
