# 5 Trees and Graphs

## Trees
* A tree is made up of nodes (data elements) with zero, one, or several references (or pointers) to other nodes. Each node has only one node referencing it.

### Implementation (tree of integers)
* Node  (parent class)
  * Array/list of children
  * Constructor initializes children
  * `get_num_children` gets length of children
  * `get_child` gets child at specified index
* IntNode (child class, extends Node)
  * Value variable
  * Constructor initializes children and value
  * `get_value` gets value of current IntNode
* Also implement error handling and methods to add and remove nodes from the tree

### Tree-Related Terms
* Root
  * The top-level node in the tree from which you have a path to every other node
* Parent
  * A node that points to other nodes is the parent of those nodes
  * Every node except the root has one parent
* Child
  * A node is the child of any node that points to it
* Descendant
  * All the nodes that can be reached by following a path of child nodes from a particular node are the descendants of that node
* Ancestor
  * An ancestor of a node is any other node for which the node is a descendant
* Leaves
  * The leaves are nodes that do not have any children

## Binary Trees
* Most tree problems involve this type of tree
* Each node has no more than two children, referred to as left and right

### Implementation
* Node
  * Node left variable
  * Node right variable
  * Value variable
  * Constructor initializes left, right, and value
  * `get_left` gets value of left
  * `get_right` gets value of right
  * `get_value` gets value of value

### Interviewing
* If an interviewer says "tree", it's a good idea to clarify whether she is referring to a generic tree or a binary tree
  * When interviewers say "tree", they often mean a binary tree

## Binary Search Trees (BST)
* Most common way to store ordered data in a tree
* The value held by a node's left child is less than or equal to its own value
* The value held by a node's right child is greater than or equal to its value
* The data in a BST is sorted by value
  * All the descendants to the left of a node are less than or equal to the node
  * All the descendants to the right of a node are greater than or equal to the node
* When interviewers say "tree", they often mean a binary search tree

### Lookup in a BST
* Lookup operations in BSTs are fast and simple
  * Fast because we eliminate half the remaining nodes from our search on each iteration by choosing to follow the left subtree or the right subtree
    * In the worst case, we will know whether the lookup was successful by the time there is only one node left to search
    * The running time of the lookup is equal to the number of times that we can halve n nodes before we get to 1
      * This number, x, is the same as the number of times we can double 1 before reaching n, and it can be expressed as 2^x=n
        * We can find x using a logarithm
  * Lookup is an O(log(n)) operation in a balanced binary search tree
    * Only true if we can guarantee that the number of nodes remaining to be searched will be halved or nearly halved on each iteration
      * In the worst case, each node only has one child, in which case we end up with a linked list and lookup becomes an O(n) operation
  * Deletion and insertion are O(log(n)) operations in binary search trees
* This is useful for data storage
* Algorithm
  * Start at the root node
  * Loop while current node is non-null
    * If the current node's value is equal to the search value
      * Return the current node
    * If the current node's value is less than the search value
      * Make the right node the current node
    * If the current node's value is greater than the search value
      * Make the left node the current node
  * End loop
* If we fall out of the loop, the node wasn't in the tree

### Other Important Properties of BSTs
* We can obtain the smallest element by following all the left children
* We can obtain the largest element by following all the right children
* The nodes can be printed out, in order, in O(n) time
* Given a node, we can find the next highest node in O(log(n)) time
* Many tree operations can be implemented recursively. The recursive implementation may not be the most efficient, but it's usually the best place to start.

## Heaps
* Heaps are trees (usually binary trees) where (in a max-heap) each child of a node has a value less than or equal to the node's own value.
  * (In a min-heap, each child is greater than or equal to its parent.)
* The root node always has the largest value in the tree, which means that we can find the maximum value in constant time.
* Insertion and deletion are still O(log(n)), but lookup becomes O(n).
* If extracting the max value needs to be fast, use a heap.

## Common Searches
* Two common search algorithms exist to accomplish the task of searching a tree without ordering.

### Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Starting with the root, we move left to right across the second level, then move left to right across the third level, and so forth.
* Uses additional memory because it is necessary to track the child nodes for all nodes on a given level while searching that level.
* Use BFS if our node is likely to be in the upper levels of the tree (BFS always examines the lowest level last).

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Follows one branch of the tree down as many levels as possible until the target node is found or the end is reached. When the search can't go down any farther, it is continued at the nearest ancestor with unexplored children.
* Has much lower memory requirements than BFS because it is not necessary to store all the child pointers at each level.
* Use DFS if our node is likely to be in the lower levels of the tree (DFS doesn't examine any single level last).

## Traversals
* Just like a search, except that instead of stopping when we find a particular target node, we visit every node in the tree.
  * Often this is used to perform some operation on each node in the tree.
* These classes of traversals can also apply to nonbinary trees as long as we have a way to classify whether a child is "less than" (on the left of) or "greater than" (on the right of) its parent node.
* Recursion is usually the simplest way to implement a depth-first traversal.
* If we're asked to implement a traversal, recursion is a good way to start thinking about the problem.

### Preorder
* Performs the operation first on the node itself, then on its left descendants, and finally on its right descendents.
  * A node is always visited before any of its children.

### Inorder
* Performs the operation first on the node's left descendants, then on the node itself, and finally on its right descendants.
  * The left subtree is visited first, then the node itself, and then the node's right subtree.

### Postorder
* Performs the operation first on the node's left descendants, then on the node's right descendants, and finally on the node itself.
  * A node is always visited after its children.

## Graphs
* More general, more complex than trees.
* Like trees, they consist of nodes with children.
  * A tree is a special case of a graph.
* Unlike tree nodes, graph nodes (or vertices) can have multiple "parents," possibly creating a loop (a cycle).
* The links between nodes, as well as the nodes themselves, may have values or weights.
  * These links are called edges because they may contain more information than just a pointer.
* In a graph, edges can be one-way or two-way.
  * A graph with one-way edges is called a directed graph.
  * A graph with only two-way pointers is called an undirected graph.
